# Nowi-Animations
FE: Awakening Sprites in Godot Game Engine!

Controls:
Move around: WASD/Arrow Keys/Xinput Controller

Action Animation: Space/Enter/Controller A or B

Do nothing for 3 seconds: Start Idle Animation


Unfortunately the Manakete Sprites don't have Idle or Action Animations :( (So they're just left walking instead)


Made with Godot 3.5
Feel free to download and do whatever!
